# Customize Scratch

This repository contains userscripts and userstyles that can be used to customize the [Scratch 3.0](https://scratch.mit.edu/) website and editor. You can install them using [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) and [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus).

Most of these are also available as part of the [Scratch Addons](https://scratchaddons.com/) browser extension, which is the recommended way to use them.

## Scratch 3.0 look for old parts of the website

Scratch 3.0 look and feel for old parts of the website (My Stuff, forums ...). You need a browser extension to install it, such as Stylus ([Chrome](chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/)). Some parameters are customizable.

## Watch YouTube videos on Scratch in full screen

When you click a link to a YouTube video on the Scratch forums, the full screen button is disabled. This userscript fixes that.

## Bring back the Discuss button

Adds the Discuss button to the navigation bar. Original [here](https://github.com/Kenny2github/kenny2github.github.io/blob/master/index/discuss.user.js).

I improved it quite a bit - now it's "instant" (there is no visible delay between the page load and the Discuss button appearing) and works on 3.0 project pages (the original from 2017 didn't).

## The Scratch 2.0 theme

Makes Scratch 3.0 more similar to Scratch 2.0. Not actively developed at the moment. Thanks to [infinitytec](https://github.com/infinitytec/I-Cant-Believe-Its-Not-2) for inspiration.
